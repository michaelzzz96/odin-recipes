    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>A chocolate cake is a divine creation, a symphony of moist, cocoa-infused layers that melt in your mouth with each heavenly bite. </p>
       <p>Whether topped with velvety ganache or a sprinkle of powdered sugar, its indulgent richness makes it the quintessential dessert, 
        capable of turning any moment into a sweet celebration.</p> 
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour </li>
        <li> 1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder </li>
        <li>2 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large eggs </li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li> 1 cup boiling water</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease two 9-inch round cake pans.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cocoa powder, sugar, and salt.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs, milk, vegetable oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Mix well until the batter is smooth and well-combined.</li>
        <li>Gradually add the boiling water to the batter, mixing continuously. The batter will be thin, but that's normal.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter evenly into the prepared cake pans.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for about 10 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li> Once the cakes are cooled, you can frost and decorate them as desired. Use chocolate frosting, ganache, or a dusting of powdered sugar for a delightful finishing touch.</li>
        <li>Slice, serve, and enjoy your homemade chocolate cake!</li>
    </ol>
